/**
 * Mocking allows our tests to be deterministic and
 * ensure that we will get the expected result every time.
 *
 * The most naïve approach to mocking in JavaScript is to
 * override an object’s properties in the test. This is
 * pretty simple and straightforward, but also fairly
 * limited.
 *
 * In this lesson, we’ll monkey patch our `getWinner`
 * function to always return the same winner every time the
 * function is called. After the test is run, we’ll clean up
 * the mock and assign the original function implementation
 * back to `getWinner`.
 *
 * Task: patch a `getWinner` function to always return the
 * same winner every time the function is called.
 *
 * Execute: Use `npx jest --watch ./src/no-framework/monkey-patching.js` to watch the test
